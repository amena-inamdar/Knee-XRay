Imagine you have a collection of pictures of bones and joints, and you want a computer to figure out if there's anything wrong with them, like arthritis or fractures.

1. Custom CNN Model:
   - It's like creating a special recipe for the computer to understand these pictures.
   - We start by teaching the computer to notice basic things in the pictures (like simple shapes and colors) in the first step.
   - Then, we make it look deeper in the second step, like trying to understand more complex patterns.
   - This process continues, making the computer smarter with each step, until it can recognize very detailed features in the pictures.
   - Finally, it makes a decision about what's in the picture based on what it learned.

2. VGG Model:
   - VGG is like a chef who's really good at recognizing things in pictures. We take advantage of what this chef already knows (pre-trained knowledge) and ask it to help us with our bone and joint pictures.
   - We freeze the chef's knowledge (so it doesn't forget) and let the chef focus on our specific bone and joint pictures. It's like having a cooking assistant who knows a lot and helps us with our special dish.

3. ResNet50, DenseNet121, EfficientNetB0 Models:
   - These are like different chefs, each with their own unique way of understanding pictures. We invite them to our kitchen (use them as pre-trained models) to see if they can help us cook our special dish of bone and joint pictures.
   - Just like with VGG, we freeze their knowledge and let them concentrate on understanding our specific pictures better. It's like having a team of chefs, each bringing their own strengths to the table.

Overall:
   - We're using these smart computer chefs (models) to look at our bone and joint pictures and tell us if there's anything wrong.
   - We take advantage of their cooking skills (pre-trained knowledge) but make sure they focus on our unique collection of pictures to do the best job possible.
   - It's like getting help from different chefs who are already good at recognizing things in pictures, so we don't have to start from scratch.

In the end, we hope our computer chefs can become really good at diagnosing bone and joint problems just by looking at pictures!
